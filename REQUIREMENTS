software:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* OS with ported SDL: tested with Linux, SunOS 5.5.1 & Windows
* ANSI/ISO C Compiler (tested with gcc 2.95.x/3.0.x, MSVC)
* make (GNU make? - there are some strange things in the Makefile)
  (extra Makefile.msvc for nmake/cl)
* SDL 1.2
* SDL_image (1.2?)

* (optional) SDL_mixer (1.2?) for music (other sound?)
* (optional) zlib for gzip'ed map files

to regenerate data files:
* (optional) sed to generate music playlist
* (optional) povray to render images
* (optional) ImageMagick to crop & resize rendered images
             [version 5.4.0 is o.k. - 4.2.9 doesn't work]

hardware:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* a fast CPU
* 16-bit capable graphics card (8-bit seems to work, too, but it's ugly);
* preferable a "direct" display, remote displays (e.g. X11 clients) are slow
* 32+ MB RAM (untestet, testing machines had 128-640MB)
